  bio_html: "<p>Born in Bari (Southern Italy), graduating from the School of Fine Arts in Naples and with a master's degree in Gender Studies from the University of Paris VIII, ‘Ndrame's practice is based mainly on menstrual blood, especially for making collages. She works with absorbent paper towels or textiles stained with menstrual blood that, once dried, are applied to different media. She collects her own blood and other people’s as well, in a community based and pluralistic approach where the relationship is part of the artistic process.
    In her work, relationships take part in her creative process: in an inclusive approach that aims at valuing the diversity of menstruating bodies, ‘Ndrame collects her own blood but also other people’s, in a community based and inclusive approach that wants to bring out the plurality of menstruating bodies. Drawing, painting and the use of other materials such as lace, gold leaf or found objects are part of her work. Being sensitive to ecological issues and upcycling is very important in her approach. Through the exploration of intimate spaces, her work addresses the question of the body, gender and social justice, as well as our relationship with living things from a feminist and queer perspective
    <p>The word ndrame is a plural noun in the dialect of Bari which means guts. This word embodies part of the geographical and cultural identity of the artist, but also a way of creating and feeling through the guts. Moreover, ndrame also refers to the Italian word for “dramma”, which etymologically means “action”, “to do”.
    Within heteropatriarchal societies, menstruations have been used to control the body and justify the inferiority of women, leading to the stigmatization of periods. Menstruations have been associated with impurity, the devil and even illnesses such as hystéria. Considering gender norms, bodily injunctions and marketing, ‘Ndrame aims to question how the dominant culture still reduces this blood to be invisible, its color whitened and its smell sanitized. On the other hand, class inequalities limit the access to menstrual products for large numbers of people around the world, leading to social exclusion and further stigmatization. Hence ‘Ndrame’s desire to rehabilitate this fluid’s image by questioning its physical, sensory, political, energetic and aesthetic dimensions. The vital force of menstrual blood contrasts with the blood of violence and the dominant male narrative of virile and oppressive strength. Menstruation represents a living body as a regenerative force and opens up various new narratives and counter-hegemonic images.</p>
    <p>‘Ndrame exhibited her work in collective exhibitions in Paris before exhibiting at the Féministival for the first time in Marseille in 2019. The same year, she joins <em>Cœur de cagoles</em>, a feminist and ecological collective committed to menstrual education.
    In 2020, she had her first solo exhibitions (Le pas sage, Marseille), at the Arts at home (Arles) and Garces (Marseille) festivals. She began an artistic collaboration with Marisoa Ramonja and Clotilde Penet (<em>Sang trinité</em>) and created urban collages on the themes of the body and menstrual education. She began working on a participative project called Jardin during a creative residency at La Réserve des Arts in Marseille. The first stage of the project was shown there in March 2021 and a second stage in June 2021 at the Espace Catalpa art therapy center in Marseille. She participated in the documentary <em>J’irai crier sur vos murs</em> (2022), produced by France television, on the theme of feminist street art in Marseille.

    A dialogue between the emotions and the guts, an attempt at healing and self-acceptance."

  garden_description: "Interest in holistic self-care practices and ecofeminism has fueled this investigation around menstrual blood and the plant kingdom.
    Little by little, it turned into a participatory project that encourages self-narrative, and exploration of the relationship with one's own menstrual blood.
    How can we connect menstruation to nature without falling into a limiting construct of “sacred femininity”, considering that not all women
    menstruate and not only women menstruate?
    Blood is a very good fertilizer and nutrient for plants, hence the desire to question the relationship between menstrual blood, earth and nature.
    Think about the continuity of life in this context, where humans and plants feed each other in a way that is not necessarily linked to gender or reproductive capacity.
    More than 40 people cisgender women, non-binary people and trans people between the ages of 20 and 46 participated in the project. Each one made their own
    blood-stained paper towels and chose a plant related to their personal history, writing a text on it.
    Each collage is made with the blood of the participant and is combined with the corresponding text.
    A common space that is both symbolic and real, where all the contributions are brought together like plants in a garden, hence the name of the project."

  oro_rosso_description_html: "<em>Oro rosso</em> (Red Gold) is a project made up of nine collages inspired by Italian journalist Stefania
    Prandi's investigation <a href='https://www.settenove.it/articoli/oro-rosso/344' target=”_blank”><em>Oro rosso. Fragole, pomodori, molestie e sfruttamento nel mediterraneo</em></a> (Settenove 2018).
    The book denounces the various discriminations - and sexual abuse in particular - suffered by women workers in
    agriculture in Italy, Spain and Morocco, where they are employed in the harvest of red fruits. Many of them come
    from Morocco, Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Moldova and move permanently or temporarily depending on the working season,
    while others are from southern Italy.
    The book was a starting point to draw attention to a reality that is still all too ignored by the media and public
    opinion; and which affects feminist, social, political and ecological issues. The analogy between the red of the
    menstrual blood and the color of the fruits handled by the workers is a tool for translating the stories of these
    women and the work of the journalist into images."


  red_thread_description: "The wool thread, soft and smooth, is reminiscent of veins, flowing blood and organs, but also
    the flow of our vital energies. This investigation starts with questioning the cold, traditional
    learning of artistic anatomy in the academic environment.
    The red thread also represents what is invisible to the eye: emotions, memories, connections and
    souvenirs embedded in bodies."

  street_art_description_html: "<p>Urban collage project started in 2020 in Marseille and continued in other cities
    (Prague, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Paris). It focuses on the theme of body, love and
    inclusive menstrual education.

    <p> This project is also part of the web-series and documentary “J’irai crier sur vos murs” (France3, 2022). </p>"


  intimate_description_html: "A number of these artworks have been created based on a personal experience and aim to denounce
    patriarchal violence (<em>In epistolary form</em>), sexist and sexual violence and the obstacles that
    survivors encounter within the system of institutional justice (<em>Pazz’ di giustizia</em>). Evoking
    the domestic space and reinvesting its objects allow to speak about patriarchal violence inside
    the family but also to ‘exorcise’ it by proposing new meanings (<em>Table service, Italian
    percolator</em>).
    Other works address inequality issues and struggles for the emancipation of the oppressed groups
    (<em>Sewing machine, Coulère</em>)."

  lovers_description_html: "Convey sensuality and eroticism through the presence of menstrual blood.
    The diptych <em>Lovers</em> is inspired by a number of sacred female representations that can be seen in churches and in Western art overall.
    Their gestures, symbols and expressions are reinterpreted in order to celebrate Sapphic love."

  blood_sea_description_html: "The work around menstrual blood, the sea and the marine world are intimately linked to the roots of the artist,
    to her family story and even to the origin of utilizing blood in her artistic work. There are some attempts to reconnect
    to the land of origin, to the dialect, the culture of southern Italy beyond its macho and oppressive aspects.
    The work <em>Bari. Land and sea</em> starts to explore this theme. It is steeped in the maritime culture of the city of Bari,
    in which marine animals and others organisms are a recurring theme.  <em>Bari. Land and sea</em> seeks to blend the local dialect
    with the medium of menstrual blood. The theme of blood also hints at fish guts, fighting to stay alive. The sea, a fluid space
    that separates and unites several lands, a space of life, of mourning, of destruction but also of regeneration and memory.
    An intimate and collective space."
